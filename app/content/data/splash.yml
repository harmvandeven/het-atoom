title: Reconstructing Het Atoom
description: |
  From June until September 1957 the large-scale exhibition Het Atoom was held at Schiphol Airport. It can be seen as the absolute high point of atomic optimism in the Netherlands. Initiated by the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce and funded by the City of Amsterdam, it painted a particularly positive picture of nuclear energy, solving the world's major problems. No expense was spared to convince visitors of the possibilities.

  Based on the archive of the foundation Het Atoom at the Amsterdam City Archives, photos of Hein de Bouter, and texts from the original exhibition catalogue, this website offers a 3D-reconstruction of the exhibition.

  This website has been developed in conjunction with the [Atomic Reactions](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/over-de-library/tu-delft-library-presenteert/atomic-reactions) programme at TU Delft Library, from March 7 until June 3 2022.
